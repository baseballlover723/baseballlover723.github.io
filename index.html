                <h4>Arimaa (Java)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Source code: <a href="https://github.com/Jernik/Arimaa">https://github.com/Jernik/Arimaa</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arimaa">What is Arimaa?</a></li>
                    <li>Description: An implementation of the game Arimaa featuring a working AI, saving, loading, undoing, and basic Arimaa gameplay</li>
                    <li>Worked with a 3 man team over a period of 8 weeks</li>
                    <li>Code was previously inherited from other students after 8 weeks of work in a test driven development class.</li>
                    <li>Written in Java, using Swing for the GUI</li>
                    <li>We worked to refactor and implement another feature as the goal for this project. The feature we chose to implement was a basic AI</li>
                    <li>Our AI choose a uniformly random move or identified that there were no valid moves left</li>
                    <li>I edited the GUI to allow users to assign one or both players to be played by the AI</li>
                    <li>
                        The main refactoring we did was changing the internal structure of the program.
                        We refactored our game pieces to be their own objects instead of being represented by characters and
                        refactored the game board into its own object based on coordinates instead of being represented by a 2d array of characters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        These refactoring broke almost all of our tests, due to the vastly changed interface of the internal components.
                        This revealed how poorly written the 130 existing tests were, necessitating the rewriting of almost every test and adding additional tests (ended with 303 tests).
                        We utilized mutation testing and code coverage to help us write useful tests.
                    </li>
                    <li>Ended with 93.5% code coverage and 89.8% mutation testing for non-gui code</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                    <li>Worked with a 3 man team over 7 weeks</li>
                    <li>For a design class, so using good design was a requirement for this project.</li>
                    <li>Used Java byte code to find information about the files given by using <a href="http://asm.ow2.org/">ASM</a>.</li>
                    <li>UML was build using <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a></li>
                    <li>Worked in week long sprints, each week implementing 2 more design patterns to identify.</li>
                    <li>Having test cases for all functionality was also required.</li>

                    <li>Source code: <a href="https://github.com/Dagwaging/Practice">https://github.com/Dagwaging/Practice</a></li>
                    <li>An Android app that would give push notifications of nearby Groupon deals as the user walked within a user set distance, while not giving notifications for deals already seen</li>
                    <li>Won the prize for "Best use of Groupon API"</li>
                    <li>Worked mostly as a team of 2 over 36 hours. (2 additional teammates working on a parallel project)</li>
                    <li>Was still learning java at the time, so I focused more on product design</li>
                    <li>Concisely listed key details about Groupon deals, while linking to the official Groupon app to purchase.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>A website that provided data visualization for Capital One users, displaying diagrams such as a map of where the user made transactions, and other items that other users who had similar spending habits bought.</li>
                    <li>Worked as a team of 4 over 36 hours.</li>
                    <li>I essentially recreated the API we were supposed to use since Capital One's api was down the entire weekend. (by the time we were notified that they wouldn't be fixed during the hackathon it was too late to start a new project)</li>
                    <li>Project was build using Ruby on Rails, with half of our team having no previous experience with Ruby on Rails</li>
                    <li>I worked on mostly the backend and eventually, creating data for our website to use (since the API was down)</li>
                    <li>I also implemented the logic for finding if two customers had similar spending habits by comparing the categorical percentages and volume of each customers transactions.</li>

                    <li>A bot that would play Twillo's Jeopardy text game, using Twillo's API to send text messages</li>
                    <li>The bot received the Jeopardy answer and then using an online database of Jeopardy questions and answers, found the correct question, and used Twillo's API to text back the correct question, repeating until the bot ran out of Twillio credit.</li>
                    <li>Coded in about 4 hours at the beginning of the hackathon and continuously running while we worked on other projects.</li>
                    <li>We were the first team to ever use a bot to play Twillo's Jeopardy game.</li>
                    <li>Our bot scored magnitudes higher than any previous score.</li>
                    <li>Our bot ended up revealing some concurrency issues in Twillo's game server, as we answered questions fast enough to make mark the correct question as wrong. (It would store a different answer then it texted us)</li>
                    <li>I mainly worked on the web scraping part of the bot.</li>
