                <h4>Arimaa (Java)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Source code: <a href="https://github.com/Jernik/Arimaa">https://github.com/Jernik/Arimaa</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arimaa">What is Arimaa?</a></li>
                    <li>Worked with a 3 man team over a period of 8 weeks</li>
                    <li>Code was previously inherited from other students after 8 weeks of work in a test driven development class.</li>
                    <li>Written in Java, using Swing for the GUI</li>
                    <li>We worked to refactor and implement another feature as the goal for this project. The feature we chose to implement was a basic AI</li>
                    <li>Our AI choose a uniformly random move or identified that there were no valid moves left</li>
                    <li>I edited the GUI to allow users to assign one or both players to be played by the AI</li>
                    <li>
                        The main refactoring we did was changing the internal structure of the program.
                        We refactored our game pieces to be their own objects instead of being represented by characters and
                        refactored the game board into its own object based on coordinates instead of being represented by a 2d array of characters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        These refactoring broke almost all of our tests, due to the vastly changed interface of the internal components.
                        This revealed how poorly written the 130 existing tests were, necessitating the rewriting of almost every test and adding additional tests (ended with 303 tests).
                        We utilized mutation testing and code coverage to help us write useful tests.
                    </li>
                    <li>Ended with 93.5% code coverage and 89.8% mutation testing for non-gui code</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                    <li>Having test cases for all functionality was also required.</li>
