                            <li>Description: An implementation of the game Arimaa featuring a working AI, saving, loading, undoing, and basic Arimaa gameplay
                            </li>
                            <li>Worked with a 3 man team over a period of 8 weeks</li>
                            <li>Code was previously inherited from other students after 8 weeks of work in a test driven development class.
                            </li>
                            <li>Written in Java, using Swing for the GUI</li>
                            <li>We worked to refactor and implement another feature as the goal for this project. The feature we chose to implement was a basic
                                AI
                            </li>
                            <li>Our AI choose a uniformly random move or identified that there were no valid moves left
                            </li>
                            <li>I edited the GUI to allow users to assign one or both players to be played by the AI
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The main refactoring we did was changing the internal structure of the program. We refactored our game pieces to be their own
                                objects instead of being represented by characters and refactored the game board into its own object based on coordinates
                                instead of being represented by a 2d array of characters.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                These refactoring broke almost all of our tests, due to the vastly changed interface of the internal components. This revealed
                                how poorly written the 130 existing tests were, necessitating the rewriting of almost every test and adding additional tests
                                (ended with 303 tests). We utilized mutation testing and code coverage to help us write useful tests.
                            </li>
                            <li>Ended with 93.5% code coverage and 89.8% mutation testing for non-gui code</li>
                        </ul>

                                A website that provided data visualization for Capital One users, displaying diagrams such as a map of where the user made
                                transactions, and other items that other users who had similar spending habits bought.

                                I essentially recreated the API we were supposed to use since Capital One's api was down the entire weekend. (by the time we
                                were notified that they wouldn't be fixed during the hackathon it was too late to start a new project)

                                I also implemented the logic for finding if two customers had similar spending habits by comparing the categorical percentages
                                and volume of each customers transactions.

                            <li>
                                The bot received the Jeopardy answer and then using an online database of Jeopardy questions and answers, found the correct
                                question, and used Twillo's API to text back the correct question, repeating until the bot ran out of Twillio credit.

                            <li>We were the first team to ever use a bot to play Twillo's Jeopardy game.</li>
                            <li>Our bot scored magnitudes higher than any previous score.</li>
                            <li>
                                Our bot ended up revealing some concurrency issues in Twillo's game server, as we answered questions fast enough to make mark
                                the correct question as wrong. (It would store a different answer then it texted us)
                            </li>
                            <li>I mainly worked on the web scraping part of the bot.</li>

                            <li>A Hipchat integration that notifies rooms when Pokemon Go's server go up or down.</li>
                            <li>It scrapes a server status website to get its data</li>
                            <li>Functional one day after Pokemon Go was released in the US</li>
                            <li>Released on the Atlassian Marketplace 5 days after Pokemon Go's release</li>
                            <li>
                                Has been installed in over 150 rooms and is actively used in over 50 rooms spanning 7 countries 12 days after Pokemon Go's

                            </li>
                            <li>One of the first chat bots for Pokemon Go on any sort of platform</li>

                                Note: the code quality of this project is not very high, since this project was extremely rushed, I would refactor it, but I
                                believe that it is feature complete and I'm also afraid of breaking existing functionality since I didn't make any regression
                                tests for this project.

                            <li>Worked by myself originally in Fall of 2014 and refactored it in Spring of 2016</li>
                            <li>Created a GUI wrapper to display modified AVL trees for my data structures class. (created out of a generic binary tree GUI
                                wrapper from a previous assignment)
                            </li>
                            <li>Used another thread to run the GUI, so the GUI would update even while using the Java debugger.</li>
                            <li>Adopted as a standard tool for future iterations of the class.</li>
                            <li>GUI is fully resizeable, and auto spaces and auto sizes nodes based on window size.</li>

                                This is functionally complete, but not presentable for release. I will add a friend to help me with the front end and will
                                convert the project to a Rails/Ember.js application. The backend will also receive significant tweaks in order to optimize our
                                API calls better

                                A website that checks if a League of Legends player is currently in a game through Riot's API and will notify the user when that
                                player is no longer in a game.

                                Started by myself, mostly completed it, and then iceboxed it, and will be restarted with a friend during the end of summer 2016.

                                Is currently a Ruby on Rails application, but will be converted to a Rails/Ember.js app. (My senior project will be a
                                Rails/Ember.js app)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                One of the challenges of this app is balancing the time resolution of checking if the player is in a game vs the rate limit of
                                our multiple API keys. We want to always be near, but not over the rate limit of API keys to allow for the shortest time
                                interval given any amount of people using the site.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The architecture of this app will work well with a Rails/Ember.js app, since there is a significant client-server loop
                                interaction, but our API calls should be on our server to be more secure. (Query the server until the player is out of a game)
